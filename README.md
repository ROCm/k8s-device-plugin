# AMD GPU device plugin for Kubernetes
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/ROCm/k8s-device-plugin)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/ROCm/k8s-device-plugin)

## Introduction
This is a [Kubernetes][k8s] [device plugin][dp] implementation that enables the registration of AMD GPU in a container cluster for compute workload.  With the appropriate hardware and this plugin deployed in your Kubernetes cluster, you will be able to run jobs that require AMD GPU.

More information about [ROCm][rocm].


## Prerequisites
* [ROCm capable machines][sysreq]
* [kubeadm capable machines][kubeadm] (if you are using kubeadm to deploy your k8s cluster)
* [ROCm kernel][rock] ([Installation guide][rocminstall]) or latest AMD GPU Linux driver ([Installation guide][amdgpuinstall])
* A [Kubernetes deployment][k8sinstall]
* Ability to run privileged pods (for example the `--allow-privileged=true` flag for kube-apiserver), if the device plugin is deployed via DaemonSet since the device plugin container requires privileged security context to access `/dev/kfd` for device health check


## Limitations
* This plugin targets Kubernetes v1.18+.

## Deployment
The device plugin needs to be run on all the nodes that are equipped with AMD GPU.  The simplest way of doing so is to create a Kubernetes [DaemonSet][ds], which runs a copy of a pod on all (or some) Nodes in the cluster.  We have a pre-built Docker image on [DockerHub][dhk8samdgpudp] that you can use for your DaemonSet.  This repository also has a pre-defined yaml file named `k8s-ds-amdgpu-dp.yaml`.  You can create a DaemonSet in your Kubernetes cluster by running this command:
```
$ kubectl create -f k8s-ds-amdgpu-dp.yaml
```
or directly pull from the web using
```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/k8s-device-plugin/master/k8s-ds-amdgpu-dp.yaml
```

If you want to enable the experimental device health check, please use `k8s-ds-amdgpu-dp-health.yaml` **after** `--allow-privileged=true` is set for kube-apiserver.

### Helm Chart

If you want to deploy this device plugin using Helm, a [Helm Chart][helmamdgpu] is available via [Artifact Hub][artifacthub].

## Example workload
You can restrict workloads to a node with a GPU by adding `resources.limits` to the pod definition.  An example pod definition is provided in `example/pod/alexnet-gpu.yaml`.  This pod runs the timing benchmark for AlexNet on AMD GPU and then goes to sleep. You can create the pod by running:
```
$ kubectl create -f alexnet-gpu.yaml
```

or

```
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/k8s-device-plugin/master/example/pod/alexnet-gpu.yaml
```

and then check the pod status by running
```
$ kubectl describe pods
```

After the pod is created and running, you can see the benchmark result by running:
```
$ kubectl logs alexnet-tf-gpu-pod alexnet-tf-gpu-container
```

For comparison, an example pod definition of running the same benchmark with CPU is provided in `example/pod/alexnet-cpu.yaml`.

## Labelling node with additional GPU properties

Please see [AMD GPU Kubernetes Node Labeller](cmd/k8s-node-labeller/README.md) for details.  An example configuration is in [k8s-ds-amdgpu-labeller.yaml](k8s-ds-amdgpu-labeller.yaml):
```
$ kubectl create -f k8s-ds-amdgpu-labeller.yaml
```

or

```
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/k8s-device-plugin/master/k8s-ds-amdgpu-labeller.yaml
```


## Notes
* This plugin uses [`go modules`][gm] for dependencies management
* Please consult the `Dockerfile` on how to build and use this plugin independent of a docker image

## TODOs
* Add proper GPU health check (health check without `/dev/kfd` access.)
